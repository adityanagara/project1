Development of the GitHub platform began on 1 October 2007.[5][6] The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta period.[7]

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard git command-line interface and all of the standard git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and git plugins have also been created by GitHub and other third parties which integrate with the platform.

The site provides social networking-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using wiki software called gollum) and a social network graph to display how developers work on their versions ("forks") of a repository and which fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.

A user must create an account in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be browsed and downloaded by anyone. With a registered user account, users are able to discuss, manage, create repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and review changes to code.

GitHub also operates other services: a pastebin-style site called Gist[7] which is for hosting code snippets (GitHub proper is for hosting larger projects), and a slide hosting service called Speaker Deck.
